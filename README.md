# `t3st`

## _Lightweight shell TAP testing library_

**TLDR: [`t3st.t`](t/t3st.t)** tests the framework and serves as an example. Run `prove [-v]`.

`t3st` is a shell library to produce [TAP output](https://testanything.org/tap-specification.html). Use it to test shell functions, or any commands / scripts. It requires only a **POSIX shell** (but works under bash / dash / busybox / mksh / zsh / BSD sh / others) and a TAP framework (**`prove`** comes with any system perl). The defaults make tests easy to write without sacrificing correctness or flexibility. The test API completely avoids **namespace pollution**, which guarantees complete interoperability with any source. Features:
- output + exit code testing, with precise final newline handling
- full shell integration (tests can be requested conditionally / from loops / inside pipelines)
- `errexit` ([`set -e`](#errexit)) and `set -u` tests
- [subshells and pipes](#subshells-and-pipes)
- repeated tests
- TAP directives (`TODO`)

*Notes*
- development takes place at [GitLab `t3st`](https://gitlab.com/kstr0k/t3st) but you can also report issues at the [GitHub `t3st` mirror](https://github.com/kstr0k/t3st).
- watch the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) if using the `git` version &mdash; there are no API guarantees at this stage

## Usage

Create a directory `t/` with "`.t`" tests. Run them using any TAP test harness, e.g.
```
prove -v  # or change the shell:
prove -e 'busybox sh'
prove -vr tests  # rename t/, recursive
```

A `sample.t` file (using defaults aggressively, and peculiar, *but not magic*, formatting to highlight tested code) might look like
```
#!/bin/sh
# This is a real shell script, there's no syntax / formatting magic

. "${0%/*}"/../k9s0ke_t3st_lib.sh  # or wherever
TTT() { k9s0ke_t3st_one "$@"; }    # or whatever

k9s0ke_t3st_enter

TTT spec='as bare as it gets' \
  -- echo
TTT nl=false \
  -- true
TTT nl=false rc='-ne 0' \
  -- false
TTT out=// hook_test_pre='cd /' spec='use eval if not single command' \
  -- eval 'printf $PWD; pwd'

if (type __str_subst >/dev/null 2>&1); then
  TTT out=abcbcbc nl=false \
  -- __str_subst abbb b bc
else k9s0ke_t3st_skip 1 \
  'no str_subst (http://gitlab.com/kstr0k/mru-files.kak/-/tree/master/k9s0ke-shlib)'
fi

k9s0ke_t3st_leave
```

That is: source [`k9s0ke_t3st_lib.sh`](k9s0ke_t3st_lib.sh) (along with any tested code you need to reference) and call
- `k9s0ke_t3st_enter [test_plan]` to start TAP output. Leave the plan empty to have the library count tests automatically and print the plan at the end.
- `k9s0ke_t3st_one [key=value]... [-- cmd args...]` (see [test function](#test-function) for defaults) for each test; it executes everything after "`--`" (a single command or function call &mdash; use `eval '...'` otherwise) in a subshell and checks the output and exit status.
- `k9s0ke_t3st_me` &mdash; alternative file-based tests (see [`_me` tests](#file-based-_me-tests))
- `k9s0ke_t3st_leave [test_plan]`: ends TAP output. If no plan was supplied on `..._enter`, it prints the supplied test plan, or generates one that matches the total number of test calls ("1..`k9s0ke_t3st_one`-call-count". The simplest setup is to not pass a test plan to either `_enter` or `leave`.

### `errexit`

**Don't "set -e" globally** (i.e. anywhere outside a `_one` or `_me` call); this would make it impossible to properly record exit status, and the library code itself must run without `set -e`. Instead, either
- set a **global errexit default** (`k9s0ke_t3st_g_errexit=true`), OR
- use `errexit=true` in individual `..._one` / `..._me` calls, OR
- define a shortcut function (`TTTe() { k9s0ke_t3st_one errexit=true $@; }`), OR
- `set -e` inside the tested code (or inside a `-- eval` argument).

To run tests with **both `set -e` and `set +e`**, create a `...-e.t` file which adds a global `errexit` default, then sources the base `.t` file. [t/t3st-e.t](t/t3st-e.t) implements a more general version of this for making scripts usable as both commands and libraries.

`set -u` does not affect operation &mdash; set it either way globally and/or use `set_pre=[-/+]u` parameters (or the `$k9s0ke_t3st_g_set_pre` global default).

## Test function

Call `k9s0ke_t3st_one` once per test in a `.t` file (you may want to alias it, e.g. to `TTT`). Minimal, though contrived, succeeding tests are the first tests in [t/t3st.t](t/t3st.t)
```
TTT() { k9s0ke_t3st_one "$@"; }

TTT -- echo   # expect out=('' + default \n)
TTT in=       # stdin = '' + \n; expect '' + \n
TTT nl=false  # stdin = /dev/null; expect out=''
```

These illustrate the defaults: call `cat` if no command is supplied, expect exit status `rc=0`, expect output `out=''`, add a **final newline** to the expected output (`nl=true`), **stdin from `/dev/null`**. The available arguments (before "`--`"; all optional, in any order; some defaults can be overridden by setting a corresponding **`k9s0ke_t3st_g_...` global**) are:
  - `nl={ true | false }`: adds a newline to the expected `out=`, as well as any `in=` parameters described below (but not to `infile= / outfile=`). This is the default (most commands work with full lines); override with `nl=false`.
  - `out='expected...'` (default: empty) compare the command's output (including any final newline) to the specified string (plus a newline if `nl=true`). For more complex conditions, use `pp=` ([extras](#extras)).
  - `outfile='...'`: load `out=` from a file (despite the name this *will not clobber* host files); `nl=` does not apply.
  - `infile={ 'path' | [-] }`: redirect the command's input, or **leave stdin alone** (use caller's environment); without any `infile=` (or `in=`), all tests run with input from **`/dev/null`**. `nl=` has no influence.
  - `in='...'`: input to pass on `stdin` to the command; an **additional newline** is added with (the default) `nl=true` (even for an empty `in`). For a completely empty input, don't specify either `in=` or `infile=`, or use `in= nl=false`; for a single newline, use `in=` or `in="$k9s0ke_t3st_nl" nl=false`. As noted above, `nl=` also affects expected output.
  - `rc={ $rc | '-$cmp $rc'}`: compare the command's exit status (`$?`) to the supplied value / uses the value as a shell `test` condition (e.g. **`rc='-lt 2'`** checks that `$?` is 0 or 1). If omitted, the expected exit is 0; if set to `''`, the exit status is ignored.
  - `spec='...'`: print this after the test result (in particular, "`# TODO`" directives mark sub-tests as possibly failing, without causing the entire test file to fail). Defaults to the first word of the command.
  - `pp='shell code...'`: post-process the output (available as `$1`) and exit status (`$2`). This code runs within a temporary function; whatever it outputs replaces the original output, and its exit status (from its last statement, or an explicit `return`) replaces the original `$?`. The `rc=` and `out=` parameters then match against these post-processed values. "`pp=`" allows test conditions to become arbitrarily complex.
  - `errexit={ true | false }`: run the test under `set -e` conditions. Defaults to false or the global `*_g_*` override. **Do not use 'set -e' globally** in your `.t` files, as [mentioned](#errexit) in the intro.
  - `set_pre={ -? | +? }*` (e.g. `set_pre=-f` turns off globbing). Defaults to nothing or the global `*_g_*` override.
  - `repeat=N`: repeat this test `N` times, or until it first fails. Defaults to 1, or `$k9s0ke_t3st_g_repeat`.
  - `cnt={ true | false }`: the test counter `$k9s0ke_t3st_cnt` normally auto-increments; this can be disabled for pipes and subshells &mdash; see below

Note that shell variables (including `in=`, `out=`, and the internal variable that stores actual output) cannot contain `NUL` (`\0`) characters. The `infile=`, however, as well as pipes / redirects, can. Preprocess any `NUL`s' before they reach the library (e.g. `eval '... | tr \\0 \\n'`; **`pp=` will not help**).

### Redirects

`infile=` can be used with any local files (permanent or created on the fly). **Here-doc** (`<<'EOF'`) redirects work directly, but can't create non-`\n`-terminated inputs.

You can specify redirects (or anything that changes the environment) in the **pre-test hook**, which runs in the same subshell as the tested command:
```
TTT hook_test_pre='cd /tmp || exit; exec 2>&1' ...
```

The standard error log of each test is normally pasted as TAP '`# `' comments below the test (`prove -v` displays them); `exec 2>/dev/null` in the hook gets rid of it.

### Subshells and pipes

`k9s0ke_t3st_one` can run in a pipeline, but it will *possibly* execute in a different (forked) process than the main script. As such, pass `infile=-` (avoids the default `</dev/null`), `cnt=false` (in case the test part of the pipeline might run in the script process), and increment the counter manually after each such test:
```
echo 'XX YY' | k9s0ke_t3st_one out=XX infile=- cnt=false \
  -- eval 'read -r x rest; echo "$x"'
k9s0ke_t3st_cnt=$(( k9s0ke_t3st_cnt + 1 ))
```

This will also be necessary if you call `k9s0ke_t3st_one` from a subshell. If the forked process might run an undetermined number of tests, use
- `k9s0ke_t3st_cnt_save` at the end of a subshell / pipe
- `k9s0ke_t3st_cnt_load` back in the top-level shell

## Extras

- `k9s0ke_t3st_bailout [message]`: stop testing, output a TAP bailout marker, exit
- `k9s0ke_t3st_skip skip_count reason`: mark a few tests as skipped. This keeps the total number of tests constant with conditional tests. Since the plan (including the final test counter) is currently printed at the end, this is optional.
- `k9s0ke_t3st_g_on_fail={bailout | skip-rest | ignore-rest }` (*experimental*): bailout or skip / ignore all tests after first (non-TODO) failure
- `..._one hook_test_pre=...`: code to be `eval`'d before the test command (defaults to `k9s0ke_t3st_g_hook_test_pre`, or empty). The framework adds additional code to this hook (`errexit` / `set_pre` setup, redirects).
- `..._one diff_on={ ok, | notok, }*`: print actual vs expected results (as TAP "# ..." comments) for some tests. The default is `notok`, or `$k9s0ke_t3st_g_diff_on` if defined. Use '`=ok,notok`' to print all diffs or '`=,`' to print none.

### Utilities

- `out_rc=$( k9s0ke_t3st_slurp_exec 'prelude' [cmd args]... )`: load a command's output plus exit code into a shell variable. Before executing the command, `eval()` the prelude (e.g. `set -e`). Use this, along with `k9s0ke_t3st_slurp_split`, to avoid truncating final newlines, as the `$()` construct does in all shells. If no command is supplied, it runs `cat`; to slurp a file, use `...slurp_exec <...`
- `k9s0ke_t3st_slurp_split "$out_rc" outvar [rcvar]`: split an `out_rc` string (as obtained above); sets `outvar` to the output and `rcvar` (if supplied and not empty) to the exit status. Both `*var` parameters are variable names (don't prepend a "`$`")
- `$k9s0ke_t3st_tmp_dir` is a temporary workdir. You can use it, but paths starting with `.t3st*` are reserved for the library.
- `k9s0ke_t3st_mktemp outvar` creates a temporary file and sets `outvar` to its path. It will be automatically removed when testing ends (`..._leave` or `..._bailout`).
- `k9s0ke_t3st_dump_str str` outputs a compact one-line representation of a string

For convenience, the library defines a few **character constants**, most notably `k9s0ke_t3st_nl` (`\n`), but also a tab, `['"<>|&;]` etc (named `k9s0ke_t3st_ch_` + the HTML entity name mostly &mdash; see the source)

## File-based (`_me`) tests

TLDR: [`t/t3st.t`](t/t3st.t) contains two `_me` tests, complete with `.out`, `.rc` and `.exec`.

Call `k9s0ke_t3st_me [ -- cmd...]`; instead of `rc=`, `in=` and `out=`, create `testname.t.{rc,in,out}` files. `nl=false` is assumed. The actual command can be supplied as `..._me()` arguments (after `--` just as with `_one`). If no command is supplied, `_me` (unlike `_one` which defaults to `cat`) looks for an `.exec` file and uses that. If the `.exec` file is not executable, it is run using the system shell `sh`.

`_me()` calls `_one()` internally, so the `in`, `rc`, and `out` defaults still apply, and other parameters can be supplied before `--`.

The expected output `.out` is read in a shell variable, so it still can't contain `NUL` (`\0`) characters. The `.in` file (if any), however, is used as an `infile=` parameter (a real redirect) and thus can contain anything.

`..._me()` can be called multiple times with different arguments, and doesn't preclude invoking regular `_one()` in the same `.t` file. You may wish to stick to one style per test file for clarity, though: all your `_me` tests can consist in a single test (plus a prelude to load the library):
```
k9s0ke_t3st_me
```

## Supported shells

While the library itself only uses POSIX shell code, it can test scripts that require `bash` (or others) &mdash; the library code will work in several shells. Use an appropriate shebang in your `.t` file, or pass `prove` a `-e` argument. For example, the following has been used to test `t3st` itself (with no errors):

```
for shell in dash bash 'busybox sh' mksh yash zsh posh
  do printf '\n%s\n' "$shell"; prove -e "$shell"
done
```

### Individual shell notes

- `posh` only fails the `errexit` test, and only because it doesn't honor `set -e` inside eval. It is currently marked as a skipped test.
- FreeBSD sh: works, but has exhibited nested parameter expansion bugs in the past (`t3st` does not currently use this)

### zsh

`t3st` itself does not depend on the following behaviors, but zsh has not been fully tested, so there may be other problems. The major differences from POSIX seem to be that by default:
- `sh_option_letters` = off; some `set -?` options have a different meaning (in particular, '`set -F`', rather than '`-f`', is `noglob`)
- `shwordsplit` = off
- `nomatch` = on (causing failures with `set -e`)
- `posixcd` = off, causing directory names starting with `+/-` to be reinterpreted as dirstack entries
- `posixargzero` = off (`$0` switches to the function name inside a function)

Use `setopt [no]...` to change these options (e.g. `nonomatch`), or use `zsh --emulate sh` to turn on POSIX mode (emulate also works as a command). Use "`[ "$ZSH_VERSION" ]`" to test if running under zsh (possibly in emulation mode). Some of these options have shortnames, but they may not be available in zsh emulation mode.

- [TAP consumers](https://testanything.org/consumers.html) if you want to go beyond the widely available `prove` command. It doesn't matter in what language they are written as long as they can parse TAP output. For example, ESR's [`tapview`](https://gitlab.com/esr/tapview/). You will still need to generate the TAP output in the first place, e.g. using `prove -a tap.tgz` (the `.t` files in the archive are, somewhat confusingly, TAP logs named like the tests that produced them)
